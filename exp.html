      <h1>Space Exploration</h1>
      <span class="design-line"></span>
      <p>Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space.
      While the exploration of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes,
      its physical exploration though is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human
      spaceflight. Space exploration, like its classical form astronomy, is one of the main sources
      for space science.</p>
      <p>space exploration, investigation, by means of crewed and uncrewed spacecraft, of the reaches
        of the universe beyond Earth’s atmosphere and the use of the information so gained to increase
        knowledge of the cosmos and benefit humanity. A complete list of all crewed spaceflights,
        with details on each mission’s accomplishments and crew, is available in the section Chronology
        of crewed spaceflights.</p>

        <h3>telescopes</h3>
        <p>The first telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 in the Netherlands by an eyeglass
          maker named Hans lippershey. The Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2 was the first space telescope launched
          on 7 December 1968.</p>
          <p>As of 2 February 2019, there was 3,891 confirmed exoplanets discovered. The Milky Way is estimated to contain
            100–400 billion stars and more than 100 billion planets. There are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the observable
            universe. GN-z11 is the most distant known object from Earth, reported as 32 billion light-years away.</p>

        <h3>First astronomical body space explorationsh</h3>
        <p>The first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna 2 reaching the Moon in 1959.The
          first soft landing on another celestial body was performed by Luna 9 landing on the Moon on 3 February 1966.
          Luna 10 became the first artificial satellite of the Moon, entering in a lunar orbit on 3 April 1966</p>
        <p>The first interplanetary flyby was the 1961 Venera 1 flyby of Venus, though the 1962 Mariner 2 was the first
          flyby of Venus to return data (closest approach 34,773 kilometers). Pioneer 6 was the first satellite to orbit
          the Sun, launched on 16 December 1965.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="right" data-aos="fade-up">
        <h3>first space station</h3>
        <p>Salyut 1 was the first space station of any kind, launched into low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1971.
          The International Space Station is currently the only flily functional space station, inhabited continuously since the year
          2000.</p>

        <h3>First interstellar space flight</h3>
        <p>Voyager 1 became the first human-made object to leave the Solar System into interstellar space on 25 August 2012.
          The probe passed the heliopause at 121 AU to enter interstellar space.</p>

        <h3>The Sun</h3>
        <p>The Sun is a major focus of space exploration. Being above the atmosphere in particliar and Earth's magnetic
          field gives access to the solar wind and infrared and litraviolet radiations that cannot reach Earth's surface.Numerous
          spacecraft dedicated to observing the Sun, beginning with the Apollo Telescope Mount, have been launched and still others have
          had solar observation as a secondary objective. Parker Solar Probe, launched in 2018, will approach the Sun to within 1/8th the
          orbit of Mercury.</p>
      </div>
      <div data-aos="fade-up">
        <h3>Earth</h3>
        <p>Space exploration has been used as a tool to understand Earth as a celestial object in its own right. Orbital missions
          can provide data for Earth that can be difficlit or impossible to obtain from a purely ground-based point of reference.</p>
      </div>
      <div data-aos="fade-up">
        <h3>Mars</h3>
        <p>The exploration of Mars has been an important part of the space exploration programs of the Soviet Union (later Russia), the
          United States, Europe, Japan and India. Dozens of robotic spacecraft, including orbiters, landers, and rovers, have been
          launched toward Mars since the 1960s. </p>
        <p>The exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars
          failing before completing their missions, with some failing before they even began. Such a high failure rate can be attributed to
          the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey, and has led researchers to jokingly speak of
          The Great Galactic Gholi which subsists on a diet of Mars probes.</p>

    <h2>Targets of exploration</h2>
    <span class="design-line"></span>
    <p>Starting in the mid-20th century probes and then human mission were sent into Earth orbit, and then on to the Moon.
      Also, probes were sent throughout the known Solar system, and into Solar orbit. Uncrewed spacecraft have been sent into
      orbit around Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury by the 21st century, and the most distance active spacecraft, Voyager
      1 and 2 traveled beyond 100 times the Earth-Sun distance.</p>

      <div data-aos="fade-up">
        <h3>Breakthrough Starshot</h3>
        <p>Breakthrough Starshot is a research and engineering project by the Breakthrough Initiatives to develop a proof-of-concept
          fleet of light sail spacecraft named StarChip, to be capable of making the journey to the Alpha Centauri star system 4.37
          light-years away.</p>

      <div data-aos="fade-up">
        <h3>Artemis program</h3>
        <p>The Artemis program is an ongoing crewed spaceflight program carried out by NASA, U.S. commercial spaceflight companies, and
          international partners such as ESA, with the goal of landing "the first woman and the next man" on the Moon, specifically
          at the lunar south pole region by 2024. Artemis would be the next step towards the long-term goal of establishing a
          sustainable presence on the Moon, laying the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually
          sending humans to Mars.</p>

      <div data-aos="fade-up">
        <h3>James Webb Space Telescope</h3>
        <p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST or "Webb") is a space telescope that is planned to be the successor to the Hubble
          Space Telescope. The JWST will provide greatly improved resolution and sensitivity over the Hubble, and will enable
          a broad range of investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology, including observing some of the most distant
          events and objects in the universe, such as the formation of the first galaxies. Other goals include understanding the
          formation of stars and planets, and direct imaging of exoplanets and novas.</p>
