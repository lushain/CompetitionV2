        <h1>Astronomy</h1>
        <span class="design-line"></span>
        <p>Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It uses mathematics,
        physics, and chemistry in order to explain their origin and evolution. Objects of interest include
        planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova
        explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation.
        More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates beyond Earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Since the late 19th century, astronomy has expanded to include astrophysics, the application
          of physical and chemical knowledge to an understanding of the nature of celestial objects and
          the physical processes that control their formation, evolution, and emission of radiation. In
          addition, the gases and dust particles around and between the stars have become the subjects of
          much research. Study of the nuclear reactions that provide the energy radiated by stars has
          shown how the diversity of atoms found in nature can be derived from a universe that, following
          the first few minutes of its existence, consisted only of hydrogen, helium, and a trace of lithium.</p>

          <h3>When we look up at the night sky, we see patterns and want to explain them.</h3>
          <img class="inlineimg" src="https://www.amnh.org/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/amnh/images/explore/ology-images/astronomy/what-is-astronomy/constellations-labeled/4800250-3-eng-US/constellations-labeled_full_990.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Early observers looking at the night sky noticed patterns in the stars . These patterns, which we call constellations,
            might appear to change place, but they don’t change shape. People around the world gave them names (like  Orion the
            hunter or Leo the lion) and told stories about them.</p>
            <p>Early observers also noticed some bright objects in the sky that seem to wander around among the stars. The
            ancient Greek philosophers called these objects “planets,” which is Greek for “wanderers.” The planets
            are our near neighbors, and they do move. They orbit the Sun , just as Earth does.</p>
        <div class="column" data-aos="fade-up">
          <h3>The sky is vast and distances between objects can be very large</h3>
          <p>To the naked eye, the stars look like tiny points of light . But stars are not tiny—they're huge, burning balls
            of gas, like our Sun. They just appear small because they are so far away. The nearest star to our solar system
            is 4 light years away, which is 20 trillion miles.</p>
          <p>Some stars that stand out in the sky aren’t actually very far away compared to other stars—they’re just incredibly
            big and bright. And some nearby stars are dim. In fact, our Sun’s closest star neighbor, Proximus Centuri, is so
            faint and tiny that we need a telescope to see it! So astronomers rely on measurements of something called
            parallax to figure out the distances of stars. They look at a nearby star from two different places and compare its
            position relative to other, much more distant stars.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column" data-aos="fade-up">
          <h3>Gravity holds everything together</h3>
          <p>If Earth is moving so fast, why don’t we fly off? Thank gravity for that. Gravity is the force of attraction
            between all objects in the universe. An object’s gravity depends on its mass —its total amount of matter , or
            “stuff.” The more massive the object, the stronger the gravitational force. And the closer two objects are,
            the stronger the gravitational pull between them.</p>
            <p>When you jump, you always fall back to Earth. What goes up must come down, right? Not quite! Something
            can go up and not come down if it reaches the escape velocity, the speed at which it breaks free from a
            planet’s gravitational pull. That’s how rockets work. Their engines are designed to push the rocket up
            so hard that it moves fast enough to get away.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column" data-aos="fade-up">
          <h3>The universe contains mysterious, invisible materials</h3>
          <p>These objects (and even trees, puppies, and ourselves) are all called matter.
            But did you know that there are things in the universe that we can’t detect, no
            matter what instruments we use? They’re called dark matter and dark energy.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dark matter-It doesn't give off light like a galaxy or absorb light like a black hole.
              Scientists know it exists because it has a gravitational pull, just like normal matter. </li>
            <li>Dark energy is a mysterious pressure working in opposition to gravity, pushing matter apart.</li>

        <h2>Observational astronomy</h2>
        <span class="design-line"></span>
        <p>The main source of information about celestial bodies and other objects is visible light, or more
          generally electromagnetic radiation. Observational astronomy may be categorized according to
          the corresponding region of the electromagnetic spectrum on which the observations are made.</p>
          <div data-aos="fade-up">
            <h3>Radio astronomy</h3>
            <p>Radio astronomy uses radiation with wavelengths greater than approximately one millimeter,
              outside the visible range. Radio astronomy is different from most other forms of observational
              astronomy in that the observed radio waves can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons</p>
          </div>
          <div data-aos="fade-up">
            <h3>Infrared astronomy</h3>
            <p>Infrared astronomy is founded on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation, wavelengths
              longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for
              studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, circumstellar disks
              or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate
              clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in
              molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey
              Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous galactic protostars and
              their host star clusters.</p>

          <div data-aos="fade-up">
            <h3>Optical Astronomy</h3>
            <p>Historically, optical astronomy, also called visible light astronomy, is the oldest form of
              astronomy. Images of observations were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century
              and most of the 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are
              made using digital detectors, particularly using charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium.</p>
          </div>
          <div data-aos="fade-up">
            <h3>Gamma-ray astronomy</h3>
            <p>Gamma ray astronomy observes astronomical objects at the shortest wavelengths of the electromagnetic
              spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory
              or by specialized telescopes called atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes.</p>
            <p>Most gamma-ray emitting sources are actually gamma-ray bursts, objects which only produce gamma
              radiation for a few milliseconds to thousands of seconds before fading away. Only 10% of gamma-ray
              sources are non-transient sources.</p>
