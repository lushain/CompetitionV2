        <p>
          Astrobiology, formerly known as exobiology, is an interdisciplinary scientific field that studies
          the origins, early evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe. Astrobiology considers
          the question of whether extraterrestrial life exists, and if it does, how humans can detect it.
        </p>
        <p>Astrobiology makes use of molecular biology, biophysics, biochemistry, chemistry, astronomy,
          physical cosmology, exoplanetology, geology, paleontology, and ichnology to investigate the
          possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize biospheres that might be different from
          that on Earth. The origin and early evolution of life is an inseparable part of the discipline
          of astrobiology. Astrobiology concerns itself with interpretation of existing scientific data,
          and although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily
          with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scichentific theories.</p>

            <h3>Planetary habitability</h3>
            <p>When looking for life on other planets like Earth, some simplifying assumptions are useful
              to reduce the size of the task of the astrobiologist. One is the informed assumption that the
              vast majority of life forms in our galaxy are based on carbon chemistries, as are all life forms
              on Earth. Carbon is well known for the unusually wide variety of molecules that can be formed around it.</p>
            <p>A third assumption is to focus on planets orbiting Sun-like stars for increased probabilities of planetary
              habitability. Very large stars have relatively short lifetimes, meaning that life might not have time
              to emerge on planets orbiting them. Very small stars provide so little heat and warmth that only planets
              in very close orbits around them would not be frozen solid, and in such close orbits these planets would
              be tidally "locked" to the star.</p>

            <h3>Communication attempts</h3>
            <p>Research on communication with extraterrestrial intelligence (CETI) focuses on composing and deciphering
               messages that could theoretically be understood by another technological civilization. Communication
               attempts by humans have included broadcasting mathematical languages, pictorial systems such as the
               Arecibo message and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering 'natural' language communication.

            <h3>Biology</h3>
            <p>Biology cannot state that a process or phenomenon, by being mathematically possible, has to exist forcibly
              in an extraterrestrial body. Biologists specify what is speculative and what is not. The discovery of
              extremophiles, organisms able to survive in extreme environments, became a core research element for
              astrobiologists, as they are important to understand four areas in the limits of life in planetary context:
              the potential for panspermia, forward contamination due to human exploration ventures, planetary
              colonization by humans, and the exploration of extinct and extant extraterrestrial life.</p>

          <h2>Life in the Solar System</h2>
          <span class="design-line"></span>
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-up" class="left-text width">
          <p>People have long speculated about the possibility of life in settings other than Earth, however,
            speculation on the nature of life elsewhere often has paid little heed to constraints imposed by
            the nature of biochemistry. The likelihood that life throughout the universe is probably carbon-based
            is suggested by the fact that carbon is one of the most abundant of the higher elements. Only two of the
            natural atoms, carbon and silicon, are known to serve as the backbones of molecules sufficiently large
            to carry biological information.</p>

        <div data-aos="fade-up" style="left: 40%" class="right-text width">
          <p>Discussion on where in the Solar System life might occur was limited historically by the understanding
            that life relies ultimately on light and warmth from the Sun and, therefore, is restricted to the surfaces
            of planets. The four most likely candidates for life in the Solar System are the planet Mars, the
            Jovian moon Europa.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-up" class="left-text width">
          <p>Mars, Enceladus and Europa are considered likely candidates in the search for life primarily because
            they may have underground liquid water, a molecule essential for life as we know it for its use as a
            solvent in cells. Water on Mars is found frozen in its polar ice caps, and newly carved gullies
            recently observed on Mars suggest that liquid water may exist, at least transiently, on the planet's surface.</p>

        <div data-aos="fade-up" style="left: 40%" class="right-text width">
          <p>Another planetary body that could potentially sustain extraterrestrial life is Saturn's largest moon,
            Titan. Titan has been described as having conditions similar to those of early Earth. On its surface,
            scientists have discovered the first liquid lakes outside Earth, but these lakes seem to be composed of
            ethane and/or methane, not water. Some scientists think it possible that these liquid hydrocarbons might
            take the place of water in living cells different from those on Earth.</p>

            <h3>Viking Program</h3>
            <p>The two Viking landers each carried four types of biological experiments to the surface of Mars in the late 1970s.
              These were the only Mars landers to carry out experiments looking specifically for metabolism by current microbial
              life on Mars. The landers used a robotic arm to collect soil samples into sealed test containers on the craft. </p>

            <p>Beagle 2 was an unsuccessful British Mars lander that formed part of the European Space Agency's 2003 Mars
              Express mission. Its primary purpose was to search for signs of life on Mars, past or present. Although it
              landed safely, it was unable to correctly deploy its solar panels and telecom antenna.</p>

              astrobiology. EXPOSE was developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) for long-term spaceflights that allow
              exposure of organic chemicals and biological samples to outer space in low Earth orbit.</p>

            <h3>Mars 2020</h3>
            <p>Mars 2020 successfully landed its rover Perseverance in Jezero Crater on 18 February 2021.
              It will investigate environments on Mars relevant to astrobiology, investigate its surface
              geological processes and history, including the assessment of its past habitability and potential
              for preservation of biosignatures and biomolecules within accessible geological materials. The
              Science Definition Team is proposing the rover collect and package at least 31 samples of rock
              cores and soil for a later mission to bring back for more definitive analysis in laboratories on Earth.</p>
